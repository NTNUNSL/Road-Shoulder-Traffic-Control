run. This lowers the total cost of maintaining your apps, enabling you to build more logic, faster.\n\nThe Framework uses new event-driven compute services, like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and more. It's a command-line tool, providing scaffolding, workflow automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture. It's also completely extensible via plugins.\n\nServerless is an MIT open-source project, actively maintained by a full-time, venture-backed team.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nf0ui3qP2E\" target=\"_blank\">Watch the video overview here.</a>\n\n[![serverless components notice](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.github.serverless/announcement-serverless-components-3.gif)](https://github.com/serverless/components)\n\n## Contents\n\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/email/sls-getting-started.gif\" />\n\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n- [Examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\n- [Services](#services)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Plugins](https://github.com/serverless/plugins)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Community](#community)\n- [Consultants](#consultants)\n- [Licensing](#licensing)\n- [Previous Version 0.5.x](#v.5)\n\n## <a name=\"quick-start\"></a>Quick Start\n\n[Watch the video guide here](https://serverless.com/framework/) or follow the steps below to create and deploy your first serverless microservice in minutes.\n\n1. **Install via npm:**\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g serverless\n```\n\n2. **Set-up your [Provider Credentials](./docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials.md)**. [Watch the video on setting up credentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSd9uYj2LJA)\n\n3. **Create a Service:**\n\nYou can create a new service or [install existing services](#how-to-install-a-service).\n\n```bash\n# Create a new Serverless Service/Project\nserverless create --template aws-nodejs --path my-service\n# Change into the newly created directory\ncd my-service\n```\n\n4. **Deploy a Service:**\n\nUse this when you have made changes to your Functions, Events or Resources in `serverless.yml` or you simply want to deploy all changes within your Service at the same time.\n\n```bash\nserverless deploy -v\n```\n\n5. **Deploy the Function:**\n\nUse this to quickly upload and overwrite your AWS Lambda code on AWS, allowing you to develop faster.\n\n```bash\nserverless deploy function -f hello\n```\n\n6. **Invoke the Function on AWS:**\n\nInvokes an AWS Lambda Function on AWS and returns logs.\n\n```bash\nserverless invoke -f hello -l\n```\n\n7. **Invoke the Function on your machine:**\n\nInvokes an AWS Lambda Function on your local machine and returns logs.\n\n```bash\nserverless invoke local -f hello -l\n```\n\n8. **Fetch the Function Logs:**\n\nOpen up a separate tab in your console and stream all logs for a specific Function using this command.\n\n```bash\nserverless logs -f hello -t\n```\n\n9. **Remove the Service:**\n\nRemoves all Functions, Events and Resources from your AWS account.\n\n```bash\nserverless remove\n```\n\n### How to Install a Service:\n\nThis is a convenience method to install a pre-made Serverless Service locally by downloading the Github repo and unzipping it. Services are listed below.\n\n```bash\nserverless install -u https://github.com/your-url-to-the-serverless-service\n```\n\nCheck out the [Serverless Framework Guide](./docs/providers/aws/guide/README.md) for more information.\n\n## <a name=\"services\"></a>Services (V1.0)\n\nThe following are services you can instantly install and use by running `serverless install --url <service-github-url>`\n\n- [serverless-examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\n- [CRUD](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-crud) - CRUD service, [Scala Port](https://github.com/jahangirmohammed/serverless-crud-scala)\n- [CRUD with FaunaDB](https://github.com/faunadb/serverless-crud) - CRUD service using FaunaDB\n- [CRUD with S3](https://github.com/tscanlin/serverless-s3-crud) - CRUD service using S3\n- [CRUD with Flask and SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/jetbridge/sls-flask) - Python [CRUD API service](https://blog.jetbridge.com/framework/) with Flask, SQLAlchemy and Swagger\n- [GraphQL Boilerplate](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-graphql) - GraphQL application Boilerplate service\n- [Authentication](https://github.com/laardee/serverless-authentication-boilerplate) - Authentication boilerplate service\n- [Mailer](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-mailer) - Service for sending emails\n- [Kinesis streams](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-kinesis-streams) - Service to showcase Kinesis stream support\n- [DynamoDB streams](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-dynamodb-streams) - Service to showcase DynamoDB stream support\n- [Landingpage backend](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-landingpage-backend) - Landingpage backend service to store E-Mail addresses\n- [Facebook Messenger Chatbot](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-facebook-messenger-bot) - Chatbot for the Facebook Messenger platform\n- [Lambda chaining](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-lambda-chaining) - Service which chains Lambdas through SNS\n- [Secured API](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-secured-api) - Service which exposes an API key accessible API\n- [Authorizer](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-authorizer) - Service that uses API Gateway custom authorizers\n- [Thumbnails](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-thumbnails) - Service that takes an image url and returns a 100x100 thumbnail\n- [Boilerplate](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-boilerplate) - Opinionated boilerplate\n- [ES6 + Jest](https://github.com/americansystems/serverless-es6-jest) - ES6 + Jest Boilerplate\n- [PHP](https://github.com/ZeroSharp/serverless-php) - Call a PHP function from your lambda\n- [Ruby](https://github.com/stewartlord/serverless-ruby) - Call a Ruby function from your lambda\n- [Slack App](https://github.com/johnagan/serverless-slack-app) - Slack App Boilerplate with OAuth and Bot actions\n- [Swift](https://github.com/choefele/swift-lambda-app) - Full-featured project template to develop Lambda functions in Swift\n- [Cloudwatch Alerts on Slack](https://github.com/dav009/serverless-aws-alarms-notifier) - Get AWS Cloudwatch alerts notifications on Slack\n\n**Note**: the `serverless install` command will only work on V1.0 or later.\n\n## <a name=\"features\"></a>Features\n\n- Supports Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, PHP, Scala, & F#\n- Manages the lifecycle of your serverless architecture (build, deploy, update, delete).\n- Safely deploy functions, events and their required resources together via provider resource managers (e.g., AWS CloudFormation).\n- Functions can be grouped (\"serverless services\") for easy management of code, resources & processes, across large projects & teams.\n- Minimal configuration and scaffolding.\n- Built-in support for multiple stages.\n- Optimized for CI/CD workflows.\n- Loaded with automation, optimization and best practices.\n- 100% Extensible: Extend or modify the Framework and its operations via Plugins.\n- An ecosystem of serverless services and plugins.\n- A passionate and welcoming community!\n\n## <a name=\"contributing\"></a>Contributing\n\nWe love our contributors!

run. This lowers the total cost of maintaining your apps, enabling you to build more logic, faster.\n\nThe Framework uses new event-driven compute services, like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and more. It's a command-line tool, providing scaffolding, workflow automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture. It's also completely extensible via plugins.\n\nServerless is an MIT open-source project, actively maintained by a full-time, venture-backed team.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nf0ui3qP2E\" target=\"_blank\">Watch the video overview here.</a>\n\n[![serverless components notice](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.github.serverless/announcement-serverless-components-3.gif)](https://github.com/serverless/components)\n\n## Contents\n\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/email/sls-getting-started.gif\" />\n\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n- [Examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\n- [Services](#services)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Plugins](https://github.com/serverless/plugins)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Community](#community)\n- [Consultants](#consultants)\n- [Licensing](#licensing)\n- [Previous Version 0.5.x](#v.5)\n\n## <a name=\"quick-start\"></a>Quick Start\n\n[Watch the video guide here](https://serverless.com/framework/) or follow the steps below to create and deploy your first serverless microservice in minutes.\n\n1. **Install via npm:**\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g serverless\n```\n\n2. **Set-up your [Provider Credentials](./docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials.md)**. [Watch the video on setting up credentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSd9uYj2LJA)\n\n3. **Create a Service:**\n\nYou can create a new service or [install existing services](#how-to-install-a-service).\n\n```bash\n# Create a new Serverless Service/Project\nserverless create --template aws-nodejs --path my-service\n# Change into the newly created directory\ncd my-service\n```\n\n4. **Deploy a Service:**\n\nUse this when you have made changes to your Functions, Events or Resources in `serverless.yml` or you simply want to deploy all changes within your Service at the same time.\n\n```bash\nserverless deploy -v\n```\n\n5. **Deploy the Function:**\n\nUse this to quickly upload and overwrite your AWS Lambda code on AWS, allowing you to develop faster.\n\n```bash\nserverless deploy function -f hello\n```\n\n6. **Invoke the Function on AWS:**\n\nInvokes an AWS Lambda Function on AWS and returns logs.\n\n```bash\nserverless invoke -f hello -l\n```\n\n7. **Invoke the Function on your machine:**\n\nInvokes an AWS Lambda Function on your local machine and returns logs.\n\n```bash\nserverless invoke local -f hello -l\n```\n\n8. **Fetch the Function Logs:**\n\nOpen up a separate tab in your console and stream all logs for a specific Function using this command.\n\n```bash\nserverless logs -f hello -t\n```\n\n9. **Remove the Service:**\n\nRemoves all Functions, Events and Resources from your AWS account.\n\n```bash\nserverless remove\n```\n\n### How to Install a Service:\n\nThis is a convenience method to install a pre-made Serverless Service locally by downloading the Github repo and unzipping it. Services are listed below.\n\n```bash\nserverless install -u https://github.com/your-url-to-the-serverless-service\n```\n\nCheck out the [Serverless Framework Guide](./docs/providers/aws/guide/README.md) for more information.\n\n## <a name=\"services\"></a>Services (V1.0)\n\nThe following are services you can instantly install and use by running `serverless install --url <service-github-url>`\n\n- [serverless-examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\n- [CRUD](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-crud) - CRUD service, [Scala Port](https://github.com/jahangirmohammed/serverless-crud-scala)\n- [CRUD with FaunaDB](https://github.com/faunadb/serverless-crud) - CRUD service using FaunaDB\n- [CRUD with S3](https://github.com/tscanlin/serverless-s3-crud) - CRUD service using S3\n- [CRUD with Flask and SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/jetbridge/sls-flask) - Python [CRUD API service](https://blog.jetbridge.com/framework/) with Flask, SQLAlchemy and Swagger\n- [GraphQL Boilerplate](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-graphql) - GraphQL application Boilerplate service\n- [Authentication](https://github.com/laardee/serverless-authentication-boilerplate) - Authentication boilerplate service\n- [Mailer](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-mailer) - Service for sending emails\n- [Kinesis streams](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-kinesis-streams) - Service to showcase Kinesis stream support\n- [DynamoDB streams](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-dynamodb-streams) - Service to showcase DynamoDB stream support\n- [Landingpage backend](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-landingpage-backend) - Landingpage backend service to store E-Mail addresses\n- [Facebook Messenger Chatbot](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-facebook-messenger-bot) - Chatbot for the Facebook Messenger platform\n- [Lambda chaining](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-lambda-chaining) - Service which chains Lambdas through SNS\n- [Secured API](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-secured-api) - Service which exposes an API key accessible API\n- [Authorizer](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-authorizer) - Service that uses API Gateway custom authorizers\n- [Thumbnails](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-thumbnails) - Service that takes an image url and returns a 100x100 thumbnail\n- [Boilerplate](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-boilerplate) - Opinionated boilerplate\n- [ES6 + Jest](https://github.com/americansystems/serverless-es6-jest) - ES6 + Jest Boilerplate\n- [PHP](https://github.com/ZeroSharp/serverless-php) - Call a PHP function from your lambda\n- [Ruby](https://github.com/stewartlord/serverless-ruby) - Call a Ruby function from your lambda\n- [Slack App](https://github.com/johnagan/serverless-slack-app) - Slack App Boilerplate with OAuth and Bot actions\n- [Swift](https://github.com/choefele/swift-lambda-app) - Full-featured project template to develop Lambda functions in Swift\n- [Cloudwatch Alerts on Slack](https://github.com/dav009/serverless-aws-alarms-notifier) - Get AWS Cloudwatch alerts notifications on Slack\n\n**Note**: the `serverless install` command will only work on V1.0 or later.\n\n## <a name=\"features\"></a>Features\n\n- Supports Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, PHP, Scala, & F#\n- Manages the lifecycle of your serverless architecture (build, deploy, update, delete).\n- Safely deploy functions, events and their required resources together via provider resource managers (e.g., AWS CloudFormation).\n- Functions can be grouped (\"serverless services\") for easy management of code, resources & processes, across large projects & teams.\n- Minimal configuration and scaffolding.\n- Built-in support for multiple stages.\n- Optimized for CI/CD workflows.\n- Loaded with automation, optimization and best practices.\n- 100% Extensible: Extend or modify the Framework and its operations via Plugins.\n- An ecosystem of serverless services and plugins.\n- A passionate and welcoming community!\n\n## <a name=\"contributing\"></a>Contributing\n\nWe love our contributors!

run. This lowers the total cost of maintaining your apps, enabling you to build more logic, faster.\n\nThe Framework uses new event-driven compute services, like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and more. It's a command-line tool, providing scaffolding, workflow automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture. It's also completely extensible via plugins.\n\nServerless is an MIT open-source project, actively maintained by a full-time, venture-backed team.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nf0ui3qP2E\" target=\"_blank\">Watch the video overview here.</a>\n\n[![serverless components notice](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.github.serverless/announcement-serverless-components-3.gif)](https://github.com/serverless/components)\n\n## Contents\n\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/email/sls-getting-started.gif\" />\n\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n- [Examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\n- [Services](#services)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Plugins](https://github.com/serverless/plugins)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Community](#community)\n- [Consultants](#consultants)\n- [Licensing](#licensing)\n- [Previous Version 0.5.x](#v.5)\n\n## <a name=\"quick-start\"></a>Quick Start\n\n[Watch the video guide here](https://serverless.com/framework/) or follow the steps below to create and deploy your first serverless microservice in minutes.\n\n1. **Install via npm:**\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g serverless\n```\n\n2. **Set-up your [Provider Credentials](./docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials.md)**. [Watch the video on setting up credentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSd9uYj2LJA)\n\n3. **Create a Service:**\n\nYou can create a new service or [install existing services](#how-to-install-a-service).\n\n```bash\n# Create a new Serverless Service/Project\nserverless create --template aws-nodejs --path my-service\n# Change into the newly created directory\ncd my-service\n```\n\n4. **Deploy a Service:**\n\nUse this when you have made changes to your Functions, Events or Resources in `serverless.yml` or you simply want to deploy all changes within your Service at the same time.\n\n```bash\nserverless deploy -v\n```\n\n5. **Deploy the Function:**\n\nUse this to quickly upload and overwrite your AWS Lambda code on AWS, allowing you to develop faster.\n\n```bash\nserverless deploy function -f hello\n```\n\n6. **Invoke the Function on AWS:**\n\nInvokes an AWS Lambda Function on AWS and returns logs.\n\n```bash\nserverless invoke -f hello -l\n```\n\n7. **Invoke the Function on your machine:**\n\nInvokes an AWS Lambda Function on your local machine and returns logs.\n\n```bash\nserverless invoke local -f hello -l\n```\n\n8. **Fetch the Function Logs:**\n\nOpen up a separate tab in your console and stream all logs for a specific Function using this command.\n\n```bash\nserverless logs -f hello -t\n```\n\n9. **Remove the Service:**\n\nRemoves all Functions, Events and Resources from your AWS account.\n\n```bash\nserverless remove\n```\n\n### How to Install a Service:\n\nThis is a convenience method to install a pre-made Serverless Service locally by downloading the Github repo and unzipping it. Services are listed below.\n\n```bash\nserverless install -u https://github.com/your-url-to-the-serverless-service\n```\n\nCheck out the [Serverless Framework Guide](./docs/providers/aws/guide/README.md) for more information.\n\n## <a name=\"services\"></a>Services (V1.0)\n\nThe following are services you can instantly install and use by running `serverless install --url <service-github-url>`\n\n- [serverless-examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\n- [CRUD](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-crud) - CRUD service, [Scala Port](https://github.com/jahangirmohammed/serverless-crud-scala)\n- [CRUD with FaunaDB](https://github.com/faunadb/serverless-crud) - CRUD service using FaunaDB\n- [CRUD with S3](https://github.com/tscanlin/serverless-s3-crud) - CRUD service using S3\n- [CRUD with Flask and SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/jetbridge/sls-flask) - Python [CRUD API service](https://blog.jetbridge.com/framework/) with Flask, SQLAlchemy and Swagger\n- [GraphQL Boilerplate](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-graphql) - GraphQL application Boilerplate service\n- [Authentication](https://github.com/laardee/serverless-authentication-boilerplate) - Authentication boilerplate service\n- [Mailer](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-mailer) - Service for sending emails\n- [Kinesis streams](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-kinesis-streams) - Service to showcase Kinesis stream support\n- [DynamoDB streams](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-dynamodb-streams) - Service to showcase DynamoDB stream support\n- [Landingpage backend](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-landingpage-backend) - Landingpage backend service to store E-Mail addresses\n- [Facebook Messenger Chatbot](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-facebook-messenger-bot) - Chatbot for the Facebook Messenger platform\n- [Lambda chaining](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-lambda-chaining) - Service which chains Lambdas through SNS\n- [Secured API](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-secured-api) - Service which exposes an API key accessible API\n- [Authorizer](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-authorizer) - Service that uses API Gateway custom authorizers\n- [Thumbnails](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-thumbnails) - Service that takes an image url and returns a 100x100 thumbnail\n- [Boilerplate](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-boilerplate) - Opinionated boilerplate\n- [ES6 + Jest](https://github.com/americansystems/serverless-es6-jest) - ES6 + Jest Boilerplate\n- [PHP](https://github.com/ZeroSharp/serverless-php) - Call a PHP function from your lambda\n- [Ruby](https://github.com/stewartlord/serverless-ruby) - Call a Ruby function from your lambda\n- [Slack App](https://github.com/johnagan/serverless-slack-app) - Slack App Boilerplate with OAuth and Bot actions\n- [Swift](https://github.com/choefele/swift-lambda-app) - Full-featured project template to develop Lambda functions in Swift\n- [Cloudwatch Alerts on Slack](https://github.com/dav009/serverless-aws-alarms-notifier) - Get AWS Cloudwatch alerts notifications on Slack\n\n**Note**: the `serverless install` command will only work on V1.0 or later.\n\n## <a name=\"features\"></a>Features\n\n- Supports Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, PHP, Scala, & F#\n- Manages the lifecycle of your serverless architecture (build, deploy, update, delete).\n- Safely deploy functions, events and their required resources together via provider resource managers (e.g., AWS CloudFormation).\n- Functions can be grouped (\"serverless services\") for easy management of code, resources & processes, across large projects & teams.\n- Minimal configuration and scaffolding.\n- Built-in support for multiple stages.\n- Optimized for CI/CD workflows.\n- Loaded with automation, optimization and best practices.\n- 100% Extensible: Extend or modify the Framework and its operations via Plugins.\n- An ecosystem of serverless services and plugins.\n- A passionate and welcoming community!\n\n## <a name=\"contributing\"></a>Contributing\n\nWe love our contributors!

run. This lowers the total cost of maintaining your apps, enabling you to build more logic, faster.\n\nThe Framework uses new event-driven compute services, like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and more. It's a command-line tool, providing scaffolding, workflow automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture. It's also completely extensible via plugins.\n\nServerless is an MIT open-source project, actively maintained by a full-time, venture-backed team.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nf0ui3qP2E\" target=\"_blank\">Watch the video overview here.</a>\n\n[![serverless components notice](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.github.serverless/announcement-serverless-components-3.gif)](https://github.com/serverless/components)\n\n## Contents\n\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.site.serverless.com/email/sls-getting-started.gif\" />\n\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n- [Examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\n- [Services](#services)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Plugins](https://github.com/serverless/plugins)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Community](#community)\n- [Consultants](#consultants)\n- [Licensing](#licensing)\n- [Previous Version 0.5.x](#v.5)\n\n## <a name=\"quick-start\"></a>Quick Start\n\n[Watch the video guide here](https://serverless.com/framework/) or follow the steps below to create and deploy your first serverless microservice in minutes.\n\n1. **Install via npm:**\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g serverless\n```\n\n2. **Set-up your [Provider Credentials](./docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials.md)**. [Watch the video on setting up credentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSd9uYj2LJA)\n\n3. **Create a Service:**\n\nYou can create a new service or [install existing services](#how-to-install-a-service).\n\n```bash\n# Create a new Serverless Service/Project\nserverless create --template aws-nodejs --path my-service\n# Change into the newly created directory\ncd my-service\n```\n\n4. **Deploy a Service:**\n\nUse this when you have made changes to your Functions, Events or Resources in `serverless.yml` or you simply want to deploy all changes within your Service at the same time.\n\n```bash\nserverless deploy -v\n```\n\n5. **Deploy the Function:**\n\nUse this to quickly upload and overwrite your AWS Lambda code on AWS, allowing you to develop faster.\n\n```bash\nserverless deploy function -f hello\n```\n\n6. **Invoke the Function on AWS:**\n\nInvokes an AWS Lambda Function on AWS and returns logs.\n\n```bash\nserverless invoke -f hello -l\n```\n\n7. **Invoke the Function on your machine:**\n\nInvokes an AWS Lambda Function on your local machine and returns logs.\n\n```bash\nserverless invoke local -f hello -l\n```\n\n8. **Fetch the Function Logs:**\n\nOpen up a separate tab in your console and stream all logs for a specific Function using this command.\n\n```bash\nserverless logs -f hello -t\n```\n\n9. **Remove the Service:**\n\nRemoves all Functions, Events and Resources from your AWS account.\n\n```bash\nserverless remove\n```\n\n### How to Install a Service:\n\nThis is a convenience method to install a pre-made Serverless Service locally by downloading the Github repo and unzipping it. Services are listed below.\n\n```bash\nserverless install -u https://github.com/your-url-to-the-serverless-service\n```\n\nCheck out the [Serverless Framework Guide](./docs/providers/aws/guide/README.md) for more information.\n\n## <a name=\"services\"></a>Services (V1.0)\n\nThe following are services you can instantly install and use by running `serverless install --url <service-github-url>`\n\n- [serverless-examples](https://github.com/serverless/examples)\n- [CRUD](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-crud) - CRUD service, [Scala Port](https://github.com/jahangirmohammed/serverless-crud-scala)\n- [CRUD with FaunaDB](https://github.com/faunadb/serverless-crud) - CRUD service using FaunaDB\n- [CRUD with S3](https://github.com/tscanlin/serverless-s3-crud) - CRUD service using S3\n- [CRUD with Flask and SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/jetbridge/sls-flask) - Python [CRUD API service](https://blog.jetbridge.com/framework/) with Flask, SQLAlchemy and Swagger\n- [GraphQL Boilerplate](https://github.com/serverless/serverless-graphql) - GraphQL application Boilerplate service\n- [Authentication](https://github.com/laardee/serverless-authentication-boilerplate) - Authentication boilerplate service\n- [Mailer](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-mailer) - Service for sending emails\n- [Kinesis streams](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-kinesis-streams) - Service to showcase Kinesis stream support\n- [DynamoDB streams](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-dynamodb-streams) - Service to showcase DynamoDB stream support\n- [Landingpage backend](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-landingpage-backend) - Landingpage backend service to store E-Mail addresses\n- [Facebook Messenger Chatbot](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-facebook-messenger-bot) - Chatbot for the Facebook Messenger platform\n- [Lambda chaining](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-lambda-chaining) - Service which chains Lambdas through SNS\n- [Secured API](https://github.com/pmuens/serverless-secured-api) - Service which exposes an API key accessible API\n- [Authorizer](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-authorizer) - Service that uses API Gateway custom authorizers\n- [Thumbnails](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-thumbnails) - Service that takes an image url and returns a 100x100 thumbnail\n- [Boilerplate](https://github.com/eahefnawy/serverless-boilerplate) - Opinionated boilerplate\n- [ES6 + Jest](https://github.com/americansystems/serverless-es6-jest) - ES6 + Jest Boilerplate\n- [PHP](https://github.com/ZeroSharp/serverless-php) - Call a PHP function from your lambda\n- [Ruby](https://github.com/stewartlord/serverless-ruby) - Call a Ruby function from your lambda\n- [Slack App](https://github.com/johnagan/serverless-slack-app) - Slack App Boilerplate with OAuth and Bot actions\n- [Swift](https://github.com/choefele/swift-lambda-app) - Full-featured project template to develop Lambda functions in Swift\n- [Cloudwatch Alerts on Slack](https://github.com/dav009/serverless-aws-alarms-notifier) - Get AWS Cloudwatch alerts notifications on Slack\n\n**Note**: the `serverless install` command will only work on V1.0 or later.\n\n## <a name=\"features\"></a>Features\n\n- Supports Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, PHP, Scala, & F#\n- Manages the lifecycle of your serverless architecture (build, deploy, update, delete).\n- Safely deploy functions, events and their required resources together via provider resource managers (e.g., AWS CloudFormation).\n- Functions can be grouped (\"serverless services\") for easy management of code, resources & processes, across large projects & teams.\n- Minimal configuration and scaffolding.\n- Built-in support for multiple stages.\n- Optimized for CI/CD workflows.\n- Loaded with automation, optimization and best practices.\n- 100% Extensible: Extend or modify the Framework and its operations via Plugins.\n- An ecosystem of serverless services and plugins.\n- A passionate and welcoming community!\n\n## <a name=\"contributing\"></a>Contributing\n\nWe love our contributors!
